    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Daniel. I am currently an engineering student at Temple University but I have a background in nuclear power and naval service. I served in the U.S. Navy for 9 years where I spent the majority of my time on the USS Colorado, a fast attack virginia class submarine. I enjoy reading, hiking, playing video games and spending time with friends.
